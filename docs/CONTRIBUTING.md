Create a JSON file for the language at [localization/languages](../res/localization/languages)/`<target_language_tag>`.json, where `<target_language_tag>` is the [IETF language tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) of the target language. Use [en.json](../res/localization/languages/en.json) or [zh-Hans.json](../res/localization/languages/zh-Hans.json) as a template.
